# Buildkite Terraform Provider

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jradtilbrook/terraform-provider-buildkite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jradtilbrook/terraform-provider-buildkite)

This is a Terraform provider for Buildkite.

The provider allows you to manage resources in your Buildkite organization. Current supported resources are:

- agent tokens
- pipelines

## Installation

There are multiple ways to get a binary for this provider:

- download a pre-built release from GitHub _**recommended**_
- clone this repo and build it
- `go get github.com/jradtilbrook/terraform-provider-buildkite`

*Note*: The last 2 options will not include the version information so are not recommended

Once you have a binary you need to make sure it's on terraform plugin search path. You can get more information from
[the terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins).

## Usage

Create a API Access Tokens in Buildkite at https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens/new.  
This provider requires the token and the Buildkite organization slug in which to manage resources.

```terraform
# configure the Buildkite provider
provider "buildkite" {
    api_token = "token" # can also be set from env: BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN
    organization = "slug" # can also be set from env: BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION
}

# create an agent token with an optional description
resource "buildkite_agent_token" "token" {
    description = "default agent token"
}

# create a pipeline with default upload step
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "repo1" {
    name = "repo1"
    description = "a repository pipeline"
    repository = "git@github.com:org/repo1"
    steps = "steps:\n  - command: \"buildkite-agent pipeline upload\"\n    label: \":pipeline:\""
}

# create a pipeline with default upload step and assign team access
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "repo1" {
    name = "repo1"
    description = "a repository pipeline"
    repository = "git@github.com:org/repo1"
    steps = "steps:\n  - command: \"buildkite-agent pipeline upload\"\n    label: \":pipeline:\""

    team {
        slug = "everyone"
        access_level = "READ_ONLY"
    }
    team {
        slug = "developers"
        access_level = "BUILD_AND_READ"
    }
    team {
        slug = "admins"
        access_level = "MANAGE_BUILD_AND_READ"
    }
}
```
