# buildkite_pipeline_webhook (Resource)

This resource manages a webhook for a Buildkite pipeline's source repository.

The webhook enables automatic build triggering when changes are pushed to the repository.
Only one webhook can exist per pipeline - if a webhook already exists, it will be adopted into state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# create a pipeline
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  name       = "my pipeline"
  repository = "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git"
}

# create a webhook to automatically trigger builds on push
resource "buildkite_pipeline_webhook" "webhook" {
  pipeline_id = buildkite_pipeline.pipeline.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `pipeline_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the pipeline.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the webhook.
- `repository_url` (String) The repository URL the webhook is configured for.
- `webhook_url` (String) The Buildkite webhook URL that receives events from the repository.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# import a pipeline webhook using the pipeline's GraphQL ID
#
# you can use this query to find the pipeline ID:
# query getPipelineId {
#   pipeline(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG/PIPELINE_SLUG") {
#     id
#   }
# }
terraform import buildkite_pipeline_webhook.webhook UGlwZWxpbmUtLS0wMTkzYTNlOC1lYzc4LTQyNWEtYTM0Ny03YzRjNDczZDFlMGE=
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_pipeline_webhook.webhook
  id = "UGlwZWxpbmUtLS0wMTkzYTNlOC1lYzc4LTQyNWEtYTM0Ny03YzRjNDczZDFlMGE="
}
```
