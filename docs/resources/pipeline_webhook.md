  This resource manages a webhook for a Buildkite pipeline's source repository.
  The webhook enables automatic build triggering when changes are pushed to the repository.
  Only one webhook can exist per pipeline - if a webhook already exists, it will be adopted into state.

  ~> The repository attribute must match the pipeline's configured repository URL.
  Use repository = buildkite_pipeline.<name>.repository to keep them in sync.
  When the pipeline's repository changes, the webhook will be automatically replaced.

  ~> Warning: When the pipeline's repository URL changes, Terraform updates the pipeline

# buildkite_pipeline_webhook (Resource)

This resource manages a webhook for a Buildkite pipeline's source repository.

The webhook enables automatic build triggering when changes are pushed to the repository.
Only one webhook can exist per pipeline - if a webhook already exists, it will be adopted into state.

Only supported for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise repositories connected via a
[GitHub App](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/source-control/github#connect-your-buildkite-account-to-github-using-the-github-app).

~> The `repository` attribute must match the pipeline's configured repository URL.
Use `repository = buildkite_pipeline.<name>.repository` to keep them in sync.
When the pipeline's repository changes.

~> **Warning:** When the pipeline's repository URL changes, Terraform updates the pipeline
before replacing the webhook. Because the webhook deletion targets the pipeline's current
repository, the old repository's webhook will be orphaned. It is advisable to destroy the
webhook resource before changing the pipeline's repository URL, then re-create it afterward.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# create a pipeline
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  name       = "my pipeline"
  repository = "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git"
}

# create a webhook to automatically trigger builds on push
resource "buildkite_pipeline_webhook" "webhook" {
  pipeline_id    = buildkite_pipeline.pipeline.id
  repository     = buildkite_pipeline.pipeline.repository
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `pipeline_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the pipeline.
- `repository` (String) The repository URL the webhook is configured for. The webhook will be replaced when this value changes.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the webhook.
- `webhook_url` (String) The Buildkite webhook URL that receives events from the repository.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# import a pipeline webhook using the pipeline's GraphQL ID
#
# you can use this query to find the pipeline ID:
# query getPipelineId {
#   pipeline(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG/PIPELINE_SLUG") {
#     id
#   }
# }
terraform import buildkite_pipeline_webhook.webhook UGlwZWxpbmUtLS0wMTkzYTNlOC1lYzc4LTQyNWEtYTM0Ny03YzRjNDczZDFlMGE=
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_pipeline_webhook.webhook
  id = "UGlwZWxpbmUtLS0wMTkzYTNlOC1lYzc4LTQyNWEtYTM0Ny03YzRjNDczZDFlMGE="
}
```
