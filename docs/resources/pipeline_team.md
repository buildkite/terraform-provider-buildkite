# buildkite_pipeline_team (Resource)

Manage team access to a pipeline.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  name       = "my pipeline"
  repository = "https://github.com/..."
}

resource "buildkite_team" "team" {
  name                = "Everyone"
  privacy             = "VISIBLE"
  default_team        = false
  default_member_role = "MEMBER"
}

# allow everyone in the "Everyone" team read-only access to pipeline
resource "buildkite_pipeline_team" "pipeline_team" {
  pipeline_id  = buildkite_pipeline.pipeline.id
  team_id      = buildkite_team.team.id
  access_level = "READ_ONLY"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `access_level` (String) The access level for the team. Either `READ_ONLY`, `BUILD_AND_READ` or `MANAGE_BUILD_AND_READ`.
- `pipeline_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the pipeline.
- `team_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the team.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the pipeline-team relationship.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the pipeline-team relationship.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# import a pipeline team resource using the GraphQL ID
#
# you can use this query to find the ID:
# query getPipelineTeamId {
#   pipeline(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG/PIPELINE_SLUG") {
#     teams(first: 5, search: "PIPELINE_SEARCH_TERM") {
#       edges{
#         node{
#           id
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
terraform import buildkite_pipeline_team.guests VGVhbS0tLWU1YjQyMDQyLTUzN2QtNDZjNi04MjY0LTliZjFkMzkyYjZkNQ==
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_pipeline_team.guests
  id = "VGVhbS0tLWU1YjQyMDQyLTUzN2QtNDZjNi04MjY0LTliZjFkMzkyYjZkNQ=="
}
```
