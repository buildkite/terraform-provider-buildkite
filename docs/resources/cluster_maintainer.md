# buildkite_cluster_maintainer (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage cluster maintainers in Buildkite. Maintainers can be either users or teams
that have permission to manage a specific cluster. Find out more information in our
[documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/clusters/manage-clusters).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Add a user as a cluster maintainer
resource "buildkite_cluster_maintainer" "user_maintainer" {
  cluster_id = buildkite_cluster.primary.id
  user_id    = "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
}

# Add a team as a cluster maintainer
resource "buildkite_cluster_maintainer" "team_maintainer" {
  cluster_id = buildkite_cluster.primary.id
  team_id    = "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_id` (String) The UUID of the cluster.

### Optional

- `team_id` (String) The UUID of the team to add as a maintainer. This is mutually exclusive with user_id.
Only one of user_id or team_id can be specified.
- `user_id` (String) The UUID of the user to add as a maintainer. This is mutually exclusive with team_id.
Only one of user_id or team_id can be specified.

### Read-Only

- `actor_email` (String) The email of the actor (only for users).
- `actor_id` (String) The UUID of the actor (user or team) that is the maintainer.
- `actor_name` (String) The name of the actor.
- `actor_slug` (String) The slug of the actor (only for teams).
- `actor_type` (String) The type of the actor (user or team).
- `id` (String) The permission ID of the cluster maintainer.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# Import a cluster maintainer using {cluster_id}/{permission_id}
#
# You can find the cluster_id (cluster UUID) and the permission_id
# from the maintainers list using the cluster data source or REST
# API response from:
# GET /v2/organizations/{org_slug}/clusters/{cluster_id}/maintainers
terraform import buildkite_cluster_maintainer.user_maintainer 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef/977b68d3-f8fe-4784-8d43-5bc857e10541
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_cluster_maintainer.user_maintainer
  id = "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef/977b68d3-f8fe-4784-8d43-5bc857e10541"
}
```
