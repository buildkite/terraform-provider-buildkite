# buildkite_organization_member (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage organization membership for specific Buildkite accounts, and maintain specific membership settings.

More information on organization membership can be found in the [documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/create-your-own#next-steps) and
additionally on the organization members [GraphQL cookbook](https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/organizations).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Maintain an organization member's role (MEMBER) and SSO requirement (REQUIRED)
resource "buildkite_organization_member" "john_doe" {
  role       = "MEMBER"
  sso        = "REQUIRED"
}

# Maintain an organization member's role (ADMIN) and SSO requirement (OPTIONAL)

## Schema

### Optional

- `role` (String) The role of the organization member. Either `ADMIN` or `MEMBER`.
- `sso` (String) The SSO mode of the organization member. Either `REQUIRED` or `OPTIONAL`.

### Read-Only

- `complimentary` (Boolean) Whether this organization member is complimentary.
- `email` (String, Sensitive) The email associated with the organization member.
- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the organization member.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the organization member.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import an organization member using its GraphQL ID
#
# You can use the following GraphQL query to find associated organization members across your organization - which
# you may require to paginate through by feeding in the `endCursor` fields within the `members` query arguments (see
# the GraphQL documentation for more information at https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/graphql/schemas/object/organization):
# query getOrganizationMembers {
#   organization(slug: "ORGANIZATION"){
#     members(first: 50, order:NAME, after:""){
# .     pageInfo{
#         hasNextPage
#         endCursor
# .     }
#       edges{ 
#         node{
#           id
#           user{
#             name
#             email
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# For organization administrators, you are also able to obtain an organization member's UUID through each User's settings 
# page within a specific organization's settings. Visit https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/users for your currently
# selected organization's settings and select a specific user to see their UUID within the URL.
#
# Upon obtaining the UUID (used as MEMBER_UUID below), you can use the following GraphQL query to fetch its GraphQL ID:
# query getOrganizationMemberBySlug {
#   oorganizationMember(slug: "ORGANIZATION/MEMBER_UUUD"){
#     id
#     user {
#       name
# .     email
#     }
#   }
# }
