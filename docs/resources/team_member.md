# buildkite_team_member (Resource)

A team member resource allows for the management of team membership for existing organization users.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "buildkite_team" "everyone" {
  name                = "Everyone"
  privacy             = "VISIBLE"
  default_team        = false
  default_member_role = "MEMBER"
}

resource "buildkite_team_member" "a_smith" {
  team_id = buildkite_team.everyone.id
  user_id = "VGVhbU1lbWJlci0tLTVlZDEyMmY2LTM2NjQtNDI1MS04YzMwLTc4NjRiMDdiZDQ4Zg=="
  role    = "MEMBER"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `role` (String) The role for the user. Either `MEMBER` or `MAINTAINER`.
- `team_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the team.
- `user_id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the user.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the team membership.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the team membership.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# import a team member resource using the GraphQL ID
#
# you can use this query to find the ID:
# query getTeamMemberId {
#   organization(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG") {
#     teams(first: 2, search: "TEAM_SEARCH_TERM") {
#       edges {
#         node {
#           members(first: 2, search: "TEAM_MEMBER_SEARCH_TERM") {
#             edges {
#               node {
#                 id
#               }
#             }
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
terraform import buildkite_team_member.a_smith VGVhbU1lbWJlci0tLTVlZDEyMmY2LTM2NjQtNDI1MS04YzMwLTc4NjRiMDdiZDQ4Zg==
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_team_member.a_smith
  id = "VGVhbU1lbWJlci0tLTVlZDEyMmY2LTM2NjQtNDI1MS04YzMwLTc4NjRiMDdiZDQ4Zg=="
}
```
