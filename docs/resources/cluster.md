Clusters can be imported using their `ID`, this can be found in the Clusters's `Settings` page, e.g.

```shell
terraform import buildkite_cluster.foo Q2x1c3Rlci0tLTI3ZmFmZjA4LTA3OWEtNDk5ZC1hMmIwLTIzNmY3NWFkMWZjYg==
```

A helpful GraphQL query to get the ID of the target cluster can be found below, or [this pre-saved query](https://buildkite.com/user/graphql/console/a803f254-decf-45a3-8332-a074b0a73483) can be used as a template. You'll need to substitute in your organization's `slug`.

```graphql
query getClusters {
  organization(slug: "ORGANIZATION"){
    clusters(first: 5, order:NAME) {
      edges{
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
