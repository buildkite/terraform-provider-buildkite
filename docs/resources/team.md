```terraform
resource "buildkite_team" "everyone" {
  name                = "Everyone"
  privacy             = "VISIBLE"
  default_team        = false
  default_member_role = "MEMBER"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `default_member_role` (String) The default role for new members of the team. This can be either `MEMBER` or `MAINTAINER`.
- `default_team` (Boolean) Whether this is the default team for the organization.
- `name` (String) The name of the team.
- `privacy` (String) The privacy setting for the team. This can be either `VISIBLE` or `SECRET`.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description for the team. This is displayed in the Buildkite UI.
- `members_can_create_pipelines` (Boolean) Whether members of the team can create Pipelines.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the team.
- `slug` (String) The generated slug for the team.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the team.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `id`. For example:
```shell
# import a team resource using the GraphQL ID
#
# you can use this query to find the ID:
# query getTeamId {
#   organization(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG") {
#     teams(first: 1, search: "TEAM_SEARCH_TERM") {
#       edges {
#         node {
#           id
#           name
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
terraform import buildkite_team.everyone UGlwZWxpbmUtLS00MzVjYWQ1OC1lODFkLTQ1YWYtODYzNy1iMWNmODA3MDIzOGQ=
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_team.everyone
  id = "UGlwZWxpbmUtLS00MzVjYWQ1OC1lODFkLTQ1YWYtODYzNy1iMWNmODA3MDIzOGQ="
}
```
