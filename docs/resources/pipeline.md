# buildkite_pipeline (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage pipelines for repositories.

More information on pipelines can be found in the [documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal repository
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  name       = "repo"
  repository = "git@github.com:org/repo"
}

# with github provider settings
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  color      = "#000000"
  emoji      = ":buildkite:"
  name       = "repo"
  repository = "git@github.com:org/repo"
  
  provider_settings = {
    build_branches      = false
    build_tags          = true
    build_pull_requests = false
    trigger_mode        = "code"
  }
}
```

- `name` (String) Name to give the pipeline.
- `repository` (String) URL to the repository this pipeline is configured for.

### Optional

- `allow_rebuilds` (Boolean) Whether rebuilds are allowed for this pipeline.
- `branch_configuration` (String) Configure the pipeline to only build on this branch conditional.
- `cancel_intermediate_builds` (Boolean) Whether to cancel builds when a new commit is pushed to a matching branch.
- `cancel_intermediate_builds_branch_filter` (String) Filter the `cancel_intermediate_builds` setting based on this branch condition.
- `cluster_id` (String) Attach this pipeline to the given cluster GraphQL ID.
- `color` (String) A color hex code to represent this pipeline.
- `default_branch` (String) Default branch of the pipeline.
- `default_timeout_in_minutes` (Number) Set pipeline wide timeout for command steps.
- `description` (String) Description for the pipeline. Can include emoji ðŸ™Œ.
- `emoji` (String) An emoji that represents this pipeline.
- `maximum_timeout_in_minutes` (Number) Set pipeline wide maximum timeout for command steps.
- `provider_settings` (Attributes) Control settings depending on the VCS provider used in `repository`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--provider_settings))
- `skip_intermediate_builds` (Boolean) Whether to skip queued builds if a new commit is pushed to a matching branch.
- `skip_intermediate_builds_branch_filter` (String) Filter the `skip_intermediate_builds` setting based on this branch condition.
- `steps` (String) The YAML steps to configure for the pipeline. Defaults to `buildkite-agent pipeline upload`.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags to attribute to the pipeline. Useful for searching by in the UI.

### Read-Only

- `badge_url` (String) The badge URL showing build state.
- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the pipeline.

### Nested Schema for `provider_settings`

Optional:

- `build_branches` (Boolean) Whether to create builds when branches are pushed.
- `build_pull_request_forks` (Boolean) Whether to create builds for pull requests from third-party forks.
- `build_pull_request_labels_changed` (Boolean) Whether to create builds for pull requests when labels are added or removed.
- `build_pull_request_ready_for_review` (Boolean) Whether to create a build when a pull request changes to "Ready for review".
- `build_pull_requests` (Boolean) Whether to create builds for commits that are part of a pull request.
- `build_tags` (Boolean) Whether to create builds when tags are pushed.
- `cancel_deleted_branch_builds` (Boolean) Automatically cancel running builds for a branch if the branch is deleted.
- `filter_condition` (String) The condition to evaluate when deciding if a build should run. More details available in [the documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/conditionals#conditionals-in-pipelines).
- `filter_enabled` (Boolean) Whether to filter builds to only run when the condition in `filter_condition` is true.
- `prefix_pull_request_fork_branch_names` (Boolean) Prefix branch names for third-party fork builds to ensure they don't trigger branch conditions. For example, the main branch from some-user will become some-user:main.
- `publish_blocked_as_pending` (Boolean) The status to use for blocked builds. Pending can be used with [required status checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-required-status-checks) to prevent merging pull requests with blocked builds.
- `publish_commit_status` (Boolean) Whether to update the status of commits in Bitbucket or GitHub.
- `publish_commit_status_per_step` (Boolean) Whether to create a separate status for each job in a build, allowing you to see the status of each job directly in Bitbucket or GitHub.
- `pull_request_branch_filter_configuration` (String) Filter pull requests builds by the branch filter.
- `pull_request_branch_filter_enabled` (Boolean) Filter pull request builds.
- `separate_pull_request_statuses` (Boolean) Whether to create a separate status for pull request builds, allowing you to require a passing pull request build in your [required status checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-required-status-checks) in GitHub.
- `skip_builds_for_existing_commits` (Boolean) Whether to skip creating a new build if an existing build for the commit and branch already exists. This option is only valid if the pipeline uses a GitHub repository.
- `skip_pull_request_builds_for_existing_commits` (Boolean) Whether to skip creating a new build for a pull request if an existing build for the commit and branch already exists.
- `trigger_mode` (String) What type of event to trigger builds on. Must be one of:
	- `code` will create builds when code is pushed to GitHub.
	- `deployment` will create builds when a deployment is created in GitHub.
	- `fork` will create builds when the GitHub repository is forked.
	- `none` will not create any builds based on GitHub activity.

	-> `trigger_mode` is only valid if the pipeline uses a GitHub repository.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
