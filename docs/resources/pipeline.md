# Resource: pipeline

This resource allows you to create and manage pipelines for repositories.

Buildkite Documentation: https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines

## Example Usage

```hcl
# in ./steps.yml:
# steps:
#   - label: ':pipeline:'
#     command: buildkite-agent pipeline upload

resource "buildkite_pipeline" "repo2" {
  name       = "repo2"
  repository = "git@github.com:org/repo2"
  steps      = file("./steps.yml")

  team {
    slug         = "everyone"
    access_level = "READ_ONLY"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with command timeouts

```hcl
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "test_new" {
  name       = "Testing Timeouts"
  repository = "https://github.com/buildkite/terraform-provider-buildkite.git"

  steps = file("./deploy-steps.yml")

  default_timeout_in_minutes = 60
  maximum_timeout_in_minutes = 120
}
```

Currently, the `default_timeout_in_minutes` and `maximum_timeout_in_minutes` will be retained in state even if removed from the configuration. In order to remove them, you must set them to `0` in either the configuration or the web UI.

## Example Usage with Deletion Protection

```hcl
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "test_new" {
  name       = "Testing Timeouts"
  repository = "https://github.com/buildkite/terraform-provider-buildkite.git"

  steps = file("./deploy-steps.yml")

  deletion_protection = true
}
```

`deletion_protection` will block `destroy` actions on the **pipeline**. Attached resources, such as `schedules` will still be destroyed.

## Example Usage with Archive on Delete

```hcl
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "test_new" {
  name       = "Testing Timeouts"
  repository = "https://github.com/buildkite/terraform-provider-buildkite.git"

  steps = file("./deploy-steps.yml")

  archive_on_delete = true
}
```

`archive_on_delete` will archive the **pipeline** when `destroy` is called. Attached resources, such as `schedules` will still be destroyed. In order to delete the pipeline, `archive_on_delete` must be set to `false` in the configuration, then `destroy` must be called again.

## Example Usage with GitHub Provider Settings

```hcl
# Pipeline that should not be triggered from a GitHub webhook
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "repo2-deploy" {
  name       = "repo2"
  repository = "git@github.com:org/repo2"
  steps      = file("./deploy-steps.yml")

  provider_settings {
    trigger_mode = "none"
  }
}

# Release pipeline (triggered only when tags are pushed)
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "repo2-release" {
  name       = "repo2"
  repository = "git@github.com:org/repo2"
  steps      = file("./release-steps.yml")

  provider_settings {
    build_branches      = false
    build_tags          = true
    build_pull_requests = false
    trigger_mode        = "code"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

-   `name` - (Required) The name of the pipeline.
-   `repository` - (Required) The git URL of the repository.
-   `steps` - (Optional) The string YAML steps to run the pipeline. Defaults to `buildkite-agent pipeline upload` if not specified.
-   `description` - (Optional) A description of the pipeline.
-   `default_branch` - (Optional) The default branch to prefill when new builds are created or triggered, usually main or master but can be anything.
-   `default_timeout_in_minutes` - (Optional) The default timeout for commands in this pipeline, in minutes.
-   `maximum_timeout_in_minutes` - (Optional) The maximum timeout for commands in this pipeline, in minutes.
-   `branch_configuration` - (Optional) Limit which branches and tags cause new builds to be created, either via a code push or via the Builds REST API.
-   `skip_intermediate_builds` - (Optional, Default: `false` ) A boolean to enable automatically skipping any unstarted builds on the same branch when a new build is created.
-   `skip_intermediate_builds_branch_filter` - (Optional) Limit which branches build skipping applies to, for example `!master` will ensure that the master branch won't have its builds automatically skipped.
-   `cancel_intermediate_builds` - (Optional, Default: `false` ) A boolean to enable automatically cancelling any running builds on the same branch when a new build is created.
-   `cancel_intermediate_builds_branch_filter` - (Optional) Limit which branches build cancelling applies to, for example !master will ensure that the master branch won't have its builds automatically cancelled.
-   `allow_rebuilds` - (Optional, Default: `true` ) A boolean on whether or not to allow rebuilds for the pipeline.
-   `cluster_id` - (Optional) The GraphQL ID of the cluster you want to use for the pipeline.
-   `team` - (Optional) Set team access for the pipeline. Can be specified multiple times for each team. See [Teams Configuration](#team) below for details.
-   `tags` - (Optional) A set of tags to be set to the pipeline. For example `["terraform", "provider"]`.
-   `provider_settings` - (Optional) Source control provider settings for the pipeline. See [Provider Settings Configuration](#provider-settings-configuration) below for details.
-   `deletion_protection` - (Optional) Set to either `true` or `false`. When set to `true`, `destroy` actions on a pipeline will be blocked and fail with a message "Deletion protection is enabled for pipeline: <pipeline name>"

### Teams Configuration

The `team` block supports:

-   `slug` - (Required) The buildkite slug of the team.
-   `access_level` - (Required) The level of access to grant. Must be one of `READ_ONLY`, `BUILD_AND_READ` or `MANAGE_BUILD_AND_READ`.

### Provider Settings Configuration

-> **Note:** Supported provider settings depend on a source version control provider used by your organization.

Additional properties available for GitHub:

## Import

Pipelines can be imported using the `GraphQL ID` (not UUID), e.g.

```
$ terraform import buildkite_pipeline.fleet UGlwZWxpbmUtLS00MzVjYWQ1OC1lODFkLTQ1YWYtODYzNy1iMWNmODA3MDIzOGQ=
```

To find the ID to use, you can use the GraphQL query below. Alternatively, you could use this [pre-saved query](https://buildkite.com/user/graphql/console/04e6ac1d-222e-49f9-8167-4767ab0f5362).

```graphql
query getPipelineId {
    pipeline(slug: "ORGANIZATION_SLUG/PIPELINE_SLUG") {
        id
    }
}
```
