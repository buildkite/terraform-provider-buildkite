## Schema

### Optional

- `allowed_api_ip_addresses` (List of String) A list of IP addresses in CIDR format that are allowed to access the Buildkite API.If not set, all IP addresses are allowed (the same as setting 0.0.0.0/0).

-> The "Allowed API IP Addresses" feature must be enabled on your organization in order to manage the `allowed_api_ip_addresses` attribute.
- `enforce_2fa` (Boolean) Sets whether the organization requires two-factor authentication for all members.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GraphQL ID of the organization.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the organization.

## Import

Using `terraform import`, import resources using the `organization-slug`. For example:
```shell
# import the organization settings via the organization slug
terraform import buildkite_organization.settings my-buildkite-organization
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `organization-slug`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = buildkite_organization.settings
  id = "my-buildkite-organization"
}
```
