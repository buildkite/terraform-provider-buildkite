If the `jwks_key_id` is not specified, and the set contains exactly one key, that key will be used.
- `repository` (String) The repository that will be checked out in a build of the pipeline.
- `unsigned_steps` (String) The steps to sign in YAML format.

### Optional

- `jwks_key_id` (String) The ID of the key in the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) to use for signing. See [RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `steps` (String) The signed steps in YAML format.
