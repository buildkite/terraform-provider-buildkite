# Buildkite Provider

This provider can be used to manage resources on [buildkite.com](https://buildkite.com) via Terraform.

Two configuration values are required:

-   An API token, generated at https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens. The
    token must have the `write_pipelines, read_pipelines` REST API scopes and be enabled for GraphQL
-   A Buildkite organization slug, available by signing into buildkite.com and
    examining the URL: https://buildkite.com/<org-slug>

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    buildkite = {
      source  = "buildkite/buildkite"
      version = "0.19.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "buildkite" {
  api_token    = "token" # can also be set from env: BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN
  organization = "slug"  # can also be set from env: BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION
}
```

## Argument Reference
