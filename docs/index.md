# buildkite Provider

This provider can be used to manage resources on [buildkite.com](https://buildkite.com).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  required_providers {
    buildkite = {
      source  = "buildkite/buildkite"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Buildkite Provider
provider "buildkite" {
  organization = "buildkite"
  # Use the `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` environment variable so the token is not committed
  # api_token = ""
  
  # Optional: Configure custom timeouts (default is 180 seconds)
  timeouts = {
    read   = "180s"
    create = "180s"
    update = "180s"
    delete = "180s"
  }
}

# Add a pipeline
resource "buildkite_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  # ...
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) API token with GraphQL access and `write_pipelines`, `read_pipelines` and `write_suites` REST API scopes. You can generate a token from [your settings page](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens/new?description=terraform&scopes[]=write_pipelines&scopes[]=write_suites&scopes[]=read_pipelines&scopes[]=graphql). If not provided, the value is taken from the `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `archive_pipeline_on_delete` (Boolean) Enable this to archive pipelines when destroying the resource. This is opposed to completely deleting pipelines.
- `graphql_url` (String) Base URL for the GraphQL API to use. If not provided, the value is taken from the `BUILDKITE_GRAPHQL_URL` environment variable.
- `organization` (String) The Buildkite organization slug. This can be found on the [settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/settings) page. If not provided, the value is taken from the `BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG` environment variable.
- `rest_url` (String) Base URL for the REST API to use. If not provided, the value is taken from the `BUILDKITE_REST_URL` environment variable.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) Configuration options for request timeouts. The default timeout is 180 seconds. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
